      "The most probable disease that you have is Tuberculosis\n",
      "\n",
      "A short description of the disease is given below :\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many strains of tuberculosis resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take several types of medications for many months to eradicate the infection and prevent development of antibiotic resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although your body may harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctors make a distinction between:\n",
      "\n",
      "Latent TB. In this condition, you have a TB infection, but the bacteria remain in your body in an inactive state and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. It can turn into active TB, so treatment is important for the person with latent TB and to help control the spread of TB. An estimated 2 billion people have latent TB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active TB. This condition makes you sick and can spread to others. It can occur in the first few weeks after infection with the TB bacteria, or it might occur years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch. You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger. Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a simple skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin is injected just below the skin of your inside forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common medications and procedures suggested by other real doctors are: \n",
      "\n",
      "Medications are the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medications are the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. But treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "With tuberculosis, you must take antibiotics for at least six to nine months. The exact drugs and length of treatment depend on your age, overall health, possible drug resistance, the form of TB (latent or active) and the infection's location in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months instead of nine â€” with combined medication may be effective in keeping latent TB from becoming active TB. With the shorter course of treatment, people are more likely to take all their medication, and the risk of side effects is lessened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common medications used to treat tuberculosis include:\n",
      "Isoniazid\n",
      "Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane)\n",
      "Ethambutol (Myambutol)\n",
      "Pyrazinamide\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have drug-resistant TB, a combination of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones and injectable medications, such as amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin, are generally used for 20 to 30 months. Some types of TB are developing resistance to these medications as well.\n",
